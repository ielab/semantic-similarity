The files in the directory are:

ground_truth.txt: is the file read by all the programs, should be a symlink to the actual ground truth file, but symblinks are not nice for dropbox so its a copy

*_removed.txt: are pairs of concepts that were removed from the dataset because they don't appear in the test corpora.
